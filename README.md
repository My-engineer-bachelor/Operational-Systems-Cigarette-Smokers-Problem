# Operational Systems Cigarette Smokers Problem
This a repository containing the source code of activity from the course "Operational Systems", where I implement a semaphore based solution for the Cigarette smokers problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette smokers problem). This project was implemented using Java 1.8 with the Eclipse IDE.
